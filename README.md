# MyAptitude - ONLINE APTITUDE EXAM GENERATION SYSTEM USING WEB SCRAPING

<h1>#Abstract<h1>
In today’s fast-paced world, people like things in shortcut – quickest, fastest, easiest, least effort
path paradigm – and sometimes creating different aptitude questions sets of questions can be a hectic
task for companies while conducting aptitude rounds of employees for various job profiles and also
as we know, most of the students and freshers now a days are finding hard to clear aptitude tests too.
The online Aptitude test is one of the most important sections in all the Competitive exams, Entrance
exams, and Campus Interviews to grab Government jobs and IT Jobs. So, practicing well and
enhancing your Aptitude skill becomes essential for new students entering in the engineering sector.
Aptitude tests are tests of general intelligence that rate one's cognitive abilities. This test comprises
of various subtests that measure one's logical ability, numerical ability, and attention to detail. Over
the years, standardized aptitude tests have been introduced in the recruitment space too, and are
playing an extensive role in maintaining meritocracy in the technical market. Aptitude tests have
become of paramount importance to job seekers in today's competitive job market and it has thus
become imperative not to neglect their importance when preparing and seeking for jobs.
So, to reduce the headache of various companies to arrange or set different sets of questions papers
and also for students to get a platform where they can brush up their aptitude skills, we would be
developing an Online Aptitude Exam Generation System in which question papers would be
generated in real time and also the students can practice aptitude questions to gain a idea about what
is needed in today's era to gain success in aptitude rounds of various companies.

#Drawbacks of Existing System Architecture
This brings up the age-old debate between storing information in databases and storing it on paper.
The following issues arise when information is kept in hard copy papers.
• Lack of space – It becomes a problem in itself to find space to keep the sheets of paper being
generated as a result of the ongoing discussion. The documents being generated are too
important to be ill-treated.
• Filing poses a problem – Filing the documents categorically is a time consuming and tedious
exercise.
• Filtering is not easy – It becomes hard to filter relevant documents for the irrelevant ones if the
count of the same crosses a certain manageable number.
• Reviewing becomes time-consuming – All the process done manually at the centers and all the
records are maintained on the papers. So, the maintenance of the record is very difficult in the
departments and as well as it’s very difficult for the workers to check the record.
• Lots of Manual work: In existing system teacher have to enter questions manually one by one
which require too much efforts and time.

#Proposed System Architecture
The previous sections discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the existing system. In order to
achieve better domain results, we are proposing an innovative mechanism which allows exams
authority to conduct an online aptitude examination using web scraping. The proposed system will
have various modules for example creating a paper, Online Paper Assessment etc. We will be web
scrapping. The questions will be selected and filtered ahead according to various types or levels of
aptitude. It will create an automated real time data set as the questions will be fetched in real time
from different websites and from them the papers will be generated. So, the system will be dependent
on machines. Here there is minimum or no human intervention for thesaid process. The questions
scrapped fetched would be stored in a customized dataset and then fromthat the paper would be
generated. Once the paper has been selected dataset for the set questions along with the options and
correct answers then the examination authority can select the pattern thatis the number of questions
and minimum passing marks and same will be informed to the candidate.The candidate will attempt
the exam then he will get instant result whether he passed or not. If any organization wants same
system to be used by their own dataset for example one of the organizationor one of the companies
has its own dataset the same can be achieved through upload module. And the same questions will
be fetched from the uploaded CSV file.

#Summary
Imagine your part of a group working on a project, and your goal is to develop an online platform for 
generating aptitude exams in real-time. Instead of relying on a static set of questions, the system 
would dynamically fetch questions as needed.To accomplish this, we would leverage web scraping 
techniques to retrieve questions from varioussources. This dynamic approach not only ensures that 
the exams remain up-to-date but alsominimizes the risk of question paper leaks, which can be a 
significant concern in the education sector. Furthermore, this innovative system would reduce the 
workload for examiners who typically spend a lot of time creating question sets manually. Instead, the 
system would automate the process, generating diverse and relevant question sets efficiently. This not
only improves the quality of the exams but also frees up valuable time for educators to focus on other 
essential tasks.
